Read CSV files into DataFrames.

Transform wide-format data into long-format using pd.melt().

Rename columns and convert data types.

Check for and handle missing values and duplicates.

2. Data Integration
Merge imports, retail prices, and production into a single DataFrame final_file.

Fill missing values with 0.

Summary statistics and country/year coverage check.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Total imports, retail prices, and production by country.

Identify top contributors and countries with missing or zero values.

Summary statistics for each column.
